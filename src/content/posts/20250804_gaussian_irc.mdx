## Overview

This article describes my recommended settings for Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) calculations in Gaussian, which I use as my personal "first choice" approach. IRC calculations are essential for verifying transition states by following the reaction path from the transition state to reactants and products.

The example system used is a cycloaddition reaction transition state, but the settings can be applied to various reaction types.

## Detailed Explanation of IRC Parameters

### IRC-Specific Keywords
- `irc`: Initiates an IRC calculation
- `calcfc`: Calculates force constants at the initial point (transition state) before starting the IRC
- `maxpoints=9999`: Sets a high maximum number of points to ensure complete IRC paths
- `recalc=10`: Recalculates the Hessian every 10 points to maintain accuracy
- `lqa`: Uses the Local Quadratic Approximation algorithm, which is generally more robust than the default

## Why These Settings Work Well

### The calcfc Option
Starting with an accurate Hessian is crucial for IRC calculations. The `calcfc` option ensures that force constants are calculated at the transition state, providing a reliable starting point for following the reaction path.

### High maxpoints Value
IRC calculations can sometimes require many points to reach minima, especially for complex reactions or flat potential energy surfaces. Setting `maxpoints=9999` prevents premature termination, though most calculations will complete with far fewer points.

### Regular Hessian Recalculation
The `recalc=10` option strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Recalculating the Hessian:
- Prevents accumulation of numerical errors
- Helps navigate complex regions of the potential energy surface
- Improves convergence in difficult cases

### LQA Algorithm
The Local Quadratic Approximation algorithm often provides more stable IRC paths than the default Gonzalez-Schlegel method, especially for reactions with complex potential energy surfaces.

## Analysis of IRC Results

After performing an IRC calculation, I typically analyze:

1. **Connectivity of endpoints**: Do they match expected reactants and products?
2. **Energy profile**: Is there a smooth descent from the transition state to the minima?
3. **Structural changes**: How do key bonds and angles change along the reaction path?

The example shown here is a Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction transition state. A successful IRC calculation would show the path connecting the separated diene and dienophile to the cycloadduct product.


## Conclusion

The IRC settings outlined in this post provide a robust starting point for most reaction path calculations. The combination of `calcfc`, regular Hessian recalculation, and the LQA algorithm offers a good balance between reliability and computational efficiency.
